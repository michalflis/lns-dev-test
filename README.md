# DEV-TEST -> Solutions

Clone repository using following SSH link to get started

```
git@github.com:michalflis/lns-dev-test.git
```

# Task 1

The input is a list of integers separated by spaces. App will output the list of distinct elements sorted in ascending
order, plus the basic measurement information that contains the number of elements in the source, number of distinct
elements, min and max value.

To start the app run Main class in task1 package and follow the instructions on the console.

```
cd src/main/java/task1
java Main.java
```

Example input:

```
1 10 20 20 2 5 5 5 6 13 57 89 0 -50
```

# Task 2

The input is a list of integers separated by spaces. App will find all the pairs that sum up to 13. Each pair in the
output have first number not greater than the second one and lines are sorted in an ascending order.

To start the app run
Main class in task2 package and follow the instructions on the console.

```
cd src/main/java/task2
java Main.java
```

Example input:

```
1 2 10 7 5 3 6 6 13 0 13
```

# Task 3

The first line of input contains a positive number n, next n lines contains pairs of positive integers, where each pair
identifies a connection between two vertices in a graph. App will give us the answer for the following questions: how
many separated graphs are in the input.

To start the app run
Main class in task3 package and follow the instructions on the console.

```
cd src/main/java/task3
java Main.java
```

Example input step 1:

```
7
```
Example input step 2:

```
1 2
5 6
1 5
9 8
6 8
12 15
13 16
```
